"""
An Existence020 is a sort of Existence010 in which each Interaction has a predefined Valence.
When a given Experience is performed and a given Result is obtained, the corresponding Interaction is considered enacted.
The Existence020 is PLEASED when the enacted Interaction has a positive or null Valence, and PAINED otherwise.
An Existence020 is still a single entity rather than being split into an explicit Agent and Environment.
An Existence020 demonstrates a rudimentary decisional mechanism and a rudimentary learning mechanism.
It learns to choose the Experience that induces an Interaction that has a positive valence.
Try to change the Valences of interactions and the method giveResult(experience)
and observe that the Existence020 still learns to enact interactions that have positive valences.
